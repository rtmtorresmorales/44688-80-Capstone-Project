# Digital Asset Investment Analysis and Predictive Modelling Capstone Project Report
#Abstract 
This article presents a preliminary proposition for investment analysis for a digital asset. The analysis is based on historical data of the bitcoin price for the years 2015 to 2023.  Correlation analysis is performed, and seasonality decomposition is completed to identify trends, price movements and low and high buying seasons for this digital asset.  Based on correlation and residuals analysis an initial predictive model for the Bitcoin price is proposed using ARIMA methodology.  In summary, general findings showed seasonality of the buying and selling trends at the end of each year analyzed and correlation was reached, setting up the scenario for the presentation of a bitcoin price predictive model.  The tools used for this project included Jupiter Notebook, Latex using Oleaf, MS Word, Acrobat, Kaggle and CoinmarketCap Data Sets and Crypto and modelling was design using Pyhton and its libraries.  All details, steps, files and code for the development of this project is available in https://github.com/rtmtorresmorales/44688-80-Capstone-Project, [6]
The planned domain is Natural language processing and visualization to demonstrate trends on investment options, [5]. The goal is to analyze sentiment analysis of experts, investors and institutional investment firms. Based on current world events and the generalization of the cryptocurrencies, particularly the bitcoin, I would like to analyze investment trends to preserve capital.  I will use Kaggle data sources to obtained data sets to analyze financial trends and compare to financial reports and determine the sentiment or opinions of experts on this field .  The process will include the following steps: 
# Introduction
1. Explore for possible investment analysis scenarios
2. Search for data sources and save it to computer in CSV and MS Excel formats
3. Use python to organize and clean
4. Select appropriate data sources and columns
5. Design and run analysis model
6. Use Tableau to present visualization of relevant results
7. Present project report
# Project Goals
Based on current world events and the proliferation of the digital currencies, it is beneficial to analyze investment trends to preserve capital and enhance return on investments for such instruments, [2,3,7].The project is intended to: 

1. review forecasting and predictive modelling for the and investment instruments

2. review of historical trends of the bitcoin for the period from 2015 to 2023.  

3. generate a predictive tool for future applications to other types of investments and asset classes

This tool may identified parameters that influence the market price of the digital currency.  This exercise may be useful for the individual, institutional, or highly speculative investor.   
# Definitions
The definitions of important data attributes.
               date = date of transaction

              Open = value of bitcoin when market open

              Close = value of bitcoin when market close

              High =   highest value of bitcoin on a trading day

              Low =    lowest value of bitcoin on a trading day

              Volume = total shares traded during a trading day

              MarketCap = total value in dollars per trading day.

# The process
Steps will include:

Step 0: Design, organization, and initial setup

Step 1: Installing and Setting up required analysis tools			       

Step 2 Accessing libraries, analytical, statistical tools

Step 3:  Access Crypto Library

Step 4: Accessing Data sets - pull data from start of 2015 to present day

Step 5:  Main object definition and accessing historical bitcoin prices from bitinfocharts

Step 6: Additional historical bitcoin data from coinmarketcap

Step 7: Graphs configurations for Cryto Historical trends 2015 to 2023

Step 8: Resampling frequencies on monthly price, annual and quarterly

Step 9: Graphs configurations for Crypto frequencies

Step 10: Graphs configurations for seasonal data decomposition

Step 11 Seasonality analysis parameters definition

Step 12 Seasonality analysis for bitcoin market price per month, decomposition and visualization of results

 Step 13 Approximation of parameters using correlation plots. 

Step 14 Parameters for approximation definition using correlation.

Step 15 Model Selection and fitting

Step 16 STL-correlational decomposition and visualization of correlational results and residuals

Step 17 Model prediction
