abstract = {Mobile app development is a growing part of modern computer science degree programs.
The complexity of learning to program mobile devices and the variety of platforms
and tools for building mobile apps make course development especially challenging.
In computer science departments with limited resources, it may not be practical to
teach multiple courses in mobile app development, so an approach is presented in this
paper to teach both Android and iOS development in native Java and Objective-C in
a single semester by building parallel example projects to shorten the students' time-to-proficiency
in both environments. Sample assignments and a service-learning term project with
rubric are provided to assist faculty in developing mobile app programming courses
in their institutions.},
